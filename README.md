# Local Prison Architect Multi-Player Server
An all-in-one packaged project to setup your own local Prison Architect server!

## Quick Setup
_This only works if you are on [LAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_area_network), see [below](#playing-with-friends-wan) if unsure_
1) Redirect `ns.exitgames.com` to localhost in your hosts file.
   1) [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/AC6hs_1_yOI?si=GQp_XX3_W0V7orjV) (not mine)
   2) Add the line `127.0.0.1 ns.exitgames.com` to your hosts file.
2) Install the required dependencies.
   1) `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3) Run the local server
   1) `python main.py local`

### Playing with Friends ([WAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wide_area_network))
_If your friends are on a different network than you, such as at their house and you are at yours_
1) Find your [public IP address](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/computer-networks/what-is-public-ip-address/)
   1) In PowerShell:
      ```powershell
         (Invoke-RestMethod https://ipinfo.io).ip
      ```
   2) Or, search for [What is My IP Address](https://whatismyipaddress.com/)
2) Add a port forwarding rule.
   1) Add a rule for ports 4530-4533 (the range) to your firewall.
      1) Run this as Admin
         ```powershell
         netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="Photon Server" dir=in action=allow protocol=TCP localport=4530-4533
         ```
   2) Add a [port forwarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_forwarding) rule on your router.
      1) [Tutorial](https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/general-port-forwarding-guide)
3) Tell your friends to add a redirection from `ns.exitgames.com` to your IP address in their hosts file.
   1) For example, if your IP address is `1.2.3.4`, they should add this line to their file:
         `1.2.3.4 ns.exitgames.com`
4) Run the local server
   1) `python main.py local -l 0.0.0.0 -i [YOUR_IP_ADDRESS]`
   2) Replace `[YOUR_IP_ADDRESS]` with your public IP address.
5) _(optional)_ If your connection isn't strong, try adding `--timeout 30` to the command.

## Docker & CI/CD
This repository now includes a Docker image workflow for GitHub Container Registry (GHCR).

### Build locally
```bash
docker build -t prison-architect-server:local .
docker run --rm -p 4530-4533:4530-4533 \
   -e PUBLIC_IP=127.0.0.1 \
   prison-architect-server:local
```

### GitHub Actions workflow
The workflow is in `.github/workflows/docker-image.yml`.

- On push to `master`: builds and pushes `ghcr.io/<owner>/<repo>:latest` and a SHA tag.
- On tag `v*`: builds and pushes version tags.
- On pull request: build-only validation (no push).

## Pterodactyl Egg
An importable egg is provided at:

- `deploy/pterodactyl/egg-prison-architect-server.json`

After import:

1) Set your Docker image to your built GHCR image.
2) Configure `PUBLIC_IP`, `TIMEOUT`, `REGION`, and `MAX_PLAYERS` in the egg variables.
3) Expose/forward TCP ports `4530-4533`.
